## Abstract

{{ABSTRACT}}

## Rule Priority

<!--
  Rules are organized by impact level. When multiple rules could apply,
  follow this priority order:

  CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW

  Within the same impact level, apply the more specific rule first.
-->

| Impact | Description | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Violations cause crashes or data loss | Must fix immediately |
| **HIGH** | Significant performance or UX impact | Should fix in current PR |
| **MEDIUM** | Code quality and maintainability | Fix when touching the file |
| **LOW** | Micro-optimizations and style | Nice to have |
