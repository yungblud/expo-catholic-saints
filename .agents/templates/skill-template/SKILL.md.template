<!--
  IMPORTANT: This section determines when AI assistants activate this skill.
  Write clear, specific trigger conditions that help AI decide relevance.

  Guidelines:
  - Use action-oriented phrases ("Building...", "Working with...", "Optimizing...")
  - Include technology keywords (React Native, Expo, TypeScript, etc.)
  - Mention specific tasks or patterns (list performance, animations, etc.)
  - Be specific but not overly restrictive

  Example triggers:
  - "Building React Native or Expo applications"
  - "Optimizing list and scroll performance"
  - "Implementing animations with Reanimated"
  - "Reviewing code for performance issues"
-->
